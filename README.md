Augmented Reality Manual

## Todo

- Build a Hello-World app to validate pipeline
- creation of data set
- video data + accelerometre 
- 3D model of parts -> blender 3D object editor
- rendering engine -> D3 javascript, tree.js, opengl
- Web assembly / target desktop / c++
- 

## Workflow

- building steps for building blocks
- basic case with one step: close a bottle with bottle cap
  - recognise cap / find object and orientation and distance
  - recognise target = bottle
  - create AR steps for closing the bottle 
- v2 -> several cases:
  - additional steps: it means finding process step
  
 ## processing steps:
  - neural network dans l'image object recognition -> tensorflow, yolo? transfer learning
  - for orientation -> output is 3 axes or forward modelling -> check camera matrix 
  - (fixed point arithmectic to lightweight the network)
